  "body": "Improves performance of `lerna clean` on large projects.\r\n\r\nI fully recognize that this could be contentious, but I also didn't see an issue/conversation about it, so I figured it couldn't hurt to submit. This shaves ~19s (21% improvement!) off our monorepo build with `lerna`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# external rimraf (this PR)\r\nlerna clean --concurrency 6 --loglevel debug --yes  81.95s user 114.90s system 281% cpu 1:10.00 total\r\nlerna clean --concurrency 6 --loglevel debug --yes  78.54s user 117.52s system 282% cpu 1:09.41 total\r\n\r\nlerna clean --concurrency 3 --loglevel debug --yes  71.90s user 108.78s system 249% cpu 1:12.42 total\r\n\r\n\r\n#internal rimraf\r\nlerna clean --concurrency 6 --loglevel debug --yes  55.34s user 85.40s system 156% cpu 1:29.84 total\r\n\r\nlerna clean --concurrency 1 --loglevel debug --yes  59.14s user 94.69s system 142% cpu 1:48.14 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of conversation, I did the simplest thing I could think of, but I'm also open to exploring alternative solutions. I suspect that shelling out to `rm` and/or the windows equivalent would be even faster still, but I'll resist the urge to do that. :grin:\r\n\r\nUpdate: One downside to this approach is that `rimraf` isn't a require-time dependency anymore, which might cause static analysis (or a human with a restrictive regex) to erroneously conclude that it's not actually being used.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: Added a couple of additional timings for posterity (`--concurrency 3` for external, `--concurrency 1` for internal).",
